French Real Estate Market Segmentation & Anomaly Detection📌 Project OverviewThis project focuses on segmenting the French real estate market using official DVF (Demandes de Valeurs Foncières) data. By applying unsupervised machine learning, we identify distinct market clusters and detect pricing anomalies to distinguish between genuine real estate opportunities and data entry errors.🛠 MethodologyThe analysis follows a rigorous data science pipeline:Data Ingestion & Cleaning: Filtering raw DVF data to focus on residential properties (apartments and houses), handling multi-lot transactions, and removing non-comparable goods (parking, land, etc.).Feature Engineering: Calculation of price per square meter ($€/m^2$) and geographical encoding.Dimensionality Reduction: Use of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to handle multi-dimensional data.Clustering: Implementation of K-Means to stratify the market into 5 homogeneous groups.Anomaly Detection: Use of Isolation Forest to identify outliers with extreme price-to-surface ratios.📊 Key Results5 Market Clusters: Ranging from Cluster 0 (Premium/Parisian markets with an average of 10,211 €/$m^2$) to Cluster 1 (Rural/Low-density areas).Outlier Identification: Detection of extreme "discounts" (> 95%) in high-value areas, highlighting potential data inconsistencies or exceptional off-market transactions.📂 Project StructurePlaintext├── data/               # Documentation on data sources
